\section{Introduction}
For this section, you can write something like follows. Of course you do not have to follow exactly what is written in the intro section. I am writing this just as a guide. 

This report covers the implementation and analysis of two main areas of visual computing: \textbf{Object Tracking} and \textbf{3D Rendering}. The objective of the tracking coursework is to----, while the rendering coursework is ------. Mention the tasks for tracking and rendering.

The report is divided into two main sections. The first section focuses on the tracking tasks, and the second addresses the rendering tasks. Each section details the methods, implementation, evaluation, and further improvements for the respective tasks.

\section{Part 1: Object Tracking Coursework}

\subsection{Change Detection Using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)}
\subsubsection{Explanations}
1. Tasks to perform and how they're achieved. \\
2. Description of mathematical background.

\subsubsection{Implementation}

    %\caption{Change Detection using GMM.}
    %\label{fig:gmm}
%\end{figure}

Discuss and explain the relevant functions.

\subsubsection{Evaluation / Testing}
1. Show that it works (no need to replicate every single part of the demo). \\
2. Use of screenshots or numerical results as appropriate.

\subsubsection{Discussion}
1. Analyses of results and lessons learnt. \\
2. Limitations of the models. Suggest potential improvements if more time or resources were available.

\subsection{Further Experiments}
Future improvements to the existing models that can improve the results. Further experiments on additional inputs and their subsequent discussions.

\subsection{Custom Lucas-Kanade Optical Flow (with OpenCV GMM)}

\subsubsection{Explanations}
1. Tasks to perform and how they're achieved. \\
2. Description of mathematical background. You can describe the Lucas-Kanade optical flow algorithm, focusing on its use in tracking objects detected by GMM.

\subsubsection{Implementation}
